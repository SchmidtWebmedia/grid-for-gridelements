Frontend Editing configuration
==============================

If you use the Frontend Editing Extension (frontend_editing) and want to use the custom dropzones you must make further settings.
In this chapter I want to explain what is to do.

Frontend Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This documentation will only explain which configuration you need more. All others are explained in frontend_editing documentation.

Admin Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^

The TYPO3 admin panel must be activated for every editor which should also use the DropZones. 
After that it can be hidden for the editor.
